# malefactor
It's coming for you, and your tests.

## What?
Malefactor is a set of generators for `fast_check` that generate, occasionally, attack strings instead of what they 
were asked for, in a variety of target languages and notations, largely at random.

The idea is to keep everything consistently under attack.
